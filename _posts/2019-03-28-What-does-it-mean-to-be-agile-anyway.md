Title: What does it mean to be Agile anyway?
---

_Agile_ has become one of those terms that has become so ubiquitous in modern software development that it is in danger of losing its meaning. We so often hear of people saying they're ”doing Agile” or that their developers are following the Agile ”methodology”. 

Unfortunately, many business people have a misinformed view of what this means. Even the teams themselves who are supposedly following Agile principles don't always understand what's expected of them. 

You see, Agile is not a methodology or set of rules. You can't take a course, write an exam and expect to be “Agile”. True Agility is a way of thinking. A way of interacting and collaborating. A way of solving problems. A way of **_delivering value_** to the customer. 

Isn't this after all, the point of doing business?
