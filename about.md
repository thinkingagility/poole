> “Life’s a journey...”

I am a full-time scrum master and full-time father and husband. I’m a part-time blogger, part-time reviewer, and I'm a productivity freak as well. I also love learning and have a strong belief in the principle of lifelong learning.

In between, you might find me bush-walking (that's Aussie for hiking) in the national parks surrounding Sydney, reading or fixing stuff around the house. I love tech and will often be trying out a new productivity app I've discovered.

Enjoy reading!
